  # The use of the spread operator (*) in a Spring Boot main function is idiomatic
  # and required. We disable this rule globally to prevent false positives.

style:
  # This default Detekt rule conflicts with the 'FinalNewline' rule from the
  # 'detekt-formatting' plugin. We disable it to favor the auto-correctable version.

formatting:
  # This is the primary rule for ensuring files end with a newline. It is part of
  # the 'detekt-formatting' ruleset, which can also autocorrect issues.
